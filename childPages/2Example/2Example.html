  <h1>ZETMAN</h1>
  <!-- A section that describes the brown bear -->
  <p>etman (stylized as ZETMAN) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura. The series started as a 49-page one-shot in the 1994 Autumn Special of Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump. The story starts off with a face-off between two rival superheroes, ZET and Alphas, and then traces their origins – Jin Kanzaki, a young man with the ability to transform into a superhuman being known as ZET, and Kouga Amagi, a young man with a strong sense of justice who uses technology to fight as Alphas.
The fates of these two men and those around them intertwine as they fight to protect mankind and destroy monstrous abominations known as Players, who ironically are the creations of the Amagi Corporation, the company founded by Kouga's grandfather, Mitsugai Amagi.</p>
